Inputs:
func - a funtion with at least one real root in the form func = @(x)...
xl - lower bound
xu - upper bound
es (optional) - stopping criteria

Outputs:
root - zero of the function between lx and lu
fx - function evaluated at the root estimation
iter - number of iterations done
ea - error of the root estimation
